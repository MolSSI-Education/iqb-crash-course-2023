    "## Data Fitting\n",
    "In an earlier module, we used the `linregress` function from the scipy.stats library to perform linear regression. This is sufficient for a least squares linear fit to the data. Python contains tools that also enable us to fit data to an equation that we have defined, with two or more paramaters. So it is ideal for nonlinear curve fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we will use some familiar tools: importing csv data into a pandas dataframe and plotting results using the matplotlib.pyplot library. We will also create a function based on the Michaelis-Menten equation. The exciting part is learning how to fit the data to the function using `curve_fit` from scipy.optimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps in our process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the libraries and functions that you need, including `curve_fit` from scipy.optimize.\n",
    "1. Set up a pandas dataframe from the MM_data.csv file you saved from the previous module.\n",
    "1. Create your independent and dependent variables for curve fitting.\n",
    "1. Create a function for the equation you want to fit. The function should accept as inputs the independent variable(s) and all the parameters to be fit.\n",
    "1. Use the function `curve_fit` from the scipy.optimize library to fit your data.\n",
    "1. Extract the fit parameters from the output of `curve_fit`.\n",
    "1. Use your function to calculate y values using your fit model to see how well your model fits the data.\n",

    "To this point we have called a number of functions that are included with python libraries such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib. Most code is organized into blocks of code which perform a particular task. These code blocks are called functions. A commercial software package likely has hundreds, thousands or millions of functions. Functions break up our code into smaller, more easily understandable statements, and also allow our code to be more modular, meaning we can take pieces and reuse them. In general, each function should perform only one computational task. \n",

The function may have independent variable(s) and parameters which are passed to it; these are in parenthesis following the function name. You then add a colon after the parentheses. This causes the function body code to indent in a Jupyter notebook coding cell. In certain cases, a function may have no parameters as well. Most (though not all) functions return some type of information. It is important to note here that defining a function does not execute it.\n",

In an earlier module, there was a discussion of different ways to linearize data so that linear regression could be used, for example, taking logs of the molecular weights of protein standards to plot versus relative migration for an SDS-PAGE gel. With curve_fit, you can do a least squares regression fit for data that demonstrate nonlinear relationships."

A fit curve based on 1000 x-values will be much smoother. To do this, we first use the numpy linspace function to create a new list of 1000 x-values ranging from the minimum xdata value (using the numpy min function) to the maximum xdata value (using the numpy max function). Then we generate a fit curve using the MM function. We then add the experimental data and the smoothed fit data to the plot. Note that the experimental data is plotted using `'bo'`.
